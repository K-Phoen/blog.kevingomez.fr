        <p>As I currently am looking for a company to work with, I took some time to think
about some questions to ask in an interview to gain some insight about the

discussions.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="code-related">Code-related</h2>

<ul>
<li>How long do you expect it would take me to deploy my first change? To become productive? To understand the code base?</li>
<li>How long does it take to do a complete deployment?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your policy regarding tests?</li>
<li>Do developers get to &ldquo;explore&rdquo; solutions, technologies build prototypes? Do they get a defined fraction of time to do so?</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>

<li>Do you have a defined process to handle and communicate outages?</li>

<li>How do you decide what to build? When is a feature considered &ldquo;done&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Do you have any form of knowledge sharing?</li>
<li>Is working remotely allowed? Encouraged?</li>
