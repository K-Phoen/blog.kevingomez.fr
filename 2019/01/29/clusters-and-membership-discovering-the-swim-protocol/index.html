    <section class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        

<p>Recently, I have been playing with distributed systems in Go. I am toying around
with a distributed key-value store. Because why not?</p>

<p>This store — again, that I am building just for the sake of learning — will be
able to operate as a single instance on a server as well as inside a cluster.
And instead of defining statically through a configuration file which nodes are
part for the cluster, I want to be able to add or remove nodes dynamically.</p>

<p>Each node in the cluster must be able to answer a seemingly simple question:
« <em>Who are my (active) peers?</em> »
Or expressed in a more fancy manner: how can the cluster <strong>detect nodes addition,
nodes removal, nodes failures and propagate information</strong> across an entire cluster?</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>,
<a href="http://basho.com/products/#riak">Riak</a>, and many others could maintain a cluster?
Well, I have. And in this blog post, we&rsquo;ll see two of the protocols that this
type of service relies upon for their failure detection and memberships.</p>

<h2 id="heartbeat">Heartbeat</h2>

<p>Traditionally, distributed peer-to-peer applications rely on <em>heart-beat style</em>
protocols to detect node failures. When a failure is detected, it is usually
communicated to the cluster using some kind of broadcast or multicast subsystem.</p>

<p>We could summarize the process like this:
 * every node sends an &ldquo;heartbeat signal&rdquo; every <code>T</code> interval of time to all
    other nodes ;
 * if no heartbeat from a node <code>N</code> is received after <code>T*limit</code>,
    the non-responsive node is considered dead.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/heartbeat.svg" />
    <figcaption>Heartbeat sent to a 4-nodes cluster</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The regular heartbeats solve the failure detection problem and we can also use
the broadcast communication channel to transmit information related to which
nodes are in the cluster. So this protocol solves both the failure detection
problem and the <em>member-list</em> one.</p>

<p>But when we look more closely at what happens in the network, we notice that the
more the cluster grows, the more messages are sent.
For instance, a four-nodes cluster will send twelve heartbeats every
<code>T</code> interval, a five-nodes one will send twenty, a six-nodes one will
send thirty, … <strong>The number of signals grows quadratically with heartbeat-style
protocols</strong> and this means that a too large cluster could take down the whole
network.</p>

<h2 id="protocol-evaluation-criteria">Protocol evaluation criteria</h2>

<p>After noticing this first limitation in the heartbeat-based method, I
realized that I actually needed a way to objectively evaluate protocols.</p>

<p>Luckily, a paper called « <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf"><em>On scalable and efficient distributed failure detectors</em></a> »
published in 2001 by I. Gupta, T. D. Chandra, and G. S. Goldszmidt addresses this
topic.</p>

<p>According to them, the key characteristics of the efficiency and scalability of
distributed failure detector protocols are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Completeness</strong>: crash-failure of any group member is detected by all non-faulty members ;</li>
<li><strong>Speed of failure detection</strong>: the time interval between a member failure and its detection by some non-faulty group member ;</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: the rate of false positives of failure detection (note: <a href="http://www.ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/7192/1/95-1535.pdf">100%
accuracy is impossible on asynchronous networks</a>) ;</li>
<li><strong>Network Message Load</strong>, in bytes per second generated by the protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evaluating-heartbeat">Evaluating heartbeat</h2>

<p>In the light of our evaluation criteria, what can we say about heartbeating?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Completeness</strong>: every nodes receives heartbeats, so a node failure
will be detected independently by every other node in the cluster ;</li>
<li><strong>Speed of failure detection</strong>: this is tunable and is often set to a value
looking like <strong><code>T * limit</code></strong> which means that a failure will be
detected after <code>limit</code> intervals <code>T</code> of time ;</li>
<li><strong>Network Message Load</strong>: <strong><code>O(n²)</code></strong>, where <code>n</code> is the
number of nodes in the cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: there is a trade-off to be made here. No network being perfect,
there will always be a portion of the packets that will be lost. So if the
<code>limit</code> value is set too low (to 1, for instance), a node might
be considered dead just because the heartbeat was dropped by the network.
On the other hand, if <code>limit</code> is set to a value that is too high,
the speed of failure detection will increase accordingly.
The <strong>trade-off</strong> is therefore <strong>between speed and accuracy</strong>. With a
reliable-enough network, we can safely assume that a low <code>limit</code>
will suffice and hence we consider heartbeating as having a &ldquo;<strong>reasonably
high</strong>&rdquo; accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Back in 2002, a group of researchers from Cornell University (the same three as
previously) devised a new protocol to address the network load imposed by
traditional heart-beating protocols. They called their new protocol SWIM.</p>

<h2 id="enters-swim">Enters <em>SWIM</em></h2>

<p>The new idea introduced by <em>SWIM</em> — or <strong>S</strong>calable <strong>W</strong>eakly-consistent
<strong>I</strong>nfection-style Process Group <strong>M</strong>embership Protocol — is the separation of
the failure detection and membership update dissemination functionalities.</p>

<h3 id="failure-detection-component">Failure detection component</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the role of this component is to detect potential failures
of nodes in the cluster.</p>

<p>Like in heartbeating protocols, each node has a list of the nodes that are in
the cluster. But instead of brutally pinging all of them every <code>T</code>
interval of time, only one of them will be checked.</p>

<p>On this schema, we see a node <strong>randomly choosing</strong> another one of its peers to
check if it is still alive. It sends a <code>PING</code> message and expects an
<code>ACK</code> in response, indicating that the target node is healthy.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/swim_ping_ack.svg" />
    <figcaption>SWIM: node successfully pinged</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>If no <code>ACK</code></strong> from the node <em>C</em> <strong>is received</strong> by <em>A</em> in the pre-specified
timeout period (determined by the message round-trip time, which is chosen
smaller than the protocol period), then <strong>an indirect check is performed</strong>.</p>

<p><em>A</em> will select <code>k</code> members at random from its list of nodes and send
them a <code>REQ-PING&copy;</code> message. Each of these nodes will in turn send
a <code>PING</code> message to <em>C</em> and forward the <code>ACK</code> (if
received) to <em>A</em>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/swim_req_ping.svg" />
    <figcaption>SWIM: indirect checks from A to C</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the end of the protocol period <code>T</code>, <em>A</em> checks if it has received
any direct or indirect response from <em>C</em>. If not, it declares <em>C</em> as dead in its
local membership list and hands this update off to the dissemination component.</p>

<p>Indirect probing is a great way to avoid any congested network path between
two nodes and dropped packets, which might have caused the direct
<code>PING</code> to have failed in the first place. That&rsquo;s also why the
<code>ACK</code> is relayed back instead of being sent directly to the probing
node. The number of false-positives decreases and the accuracy is improved.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the values <code>T</code>, <code>k</code> as well as the timeout
period are parameters of the protocol and can be tuned to suit different needs
and networks.</p>

<h3 id="dissemination-component">Dissemination component</h3>

<p>Upon detecting the failure of another group member, the process multicasts this
information to the rest of the cluster as <code>failed&copy;</code> message.
A member receiving this message deletes the offending node from its local
membership list. Information about newly joined members or voluntarily
leaving members are disseminated in a similar manner.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/swim_multicast_failure.svg" />
    <figcaption>SWIM: failure of C, detected and multicast by A</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> for a new node to join the cluster, it must know the address of
at least one alive node member of the cluster. This way, it can introduce itself
to cluster and the rest of the nodes will include it to the gossips, this
allowing it to gradually receive information about all the nodes of the cluster.</p>

<h2 id="evaluating-swim">Evaluating <em>SWIM</em></h2>

<p>If we sum up what <em>SWIM</em> does so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>it splits the failure detection and the dissemination components ;</li>
<li>each node of the cluster periodically check the health of a random node of
 its memberlist (either directly or indirectly) ;</li>
<li><code>join()</code> and <code>failed()</code> events are multicast.</li>
</ul>

<p>So given our evaluation criteria, what can we say about the protocol?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Completeness</strong>: as each node randomly selects at each protocol period
a node to check, <strong>all nodes will eventually be checked</strong> and all faulty-nodes
will be detected ;</li>
<li><strong>Speed of failure detection</strong>: the expected time between a failure of a node
and its detection by <em>some</em> other node is at most
<code>T&rsquo; * (1 / (1 - e^Qf))</code>, where <code>Qf</code> is the fraction of
non-faulty nodes in the cluster and <code>T&rsquo;</code> is the protocol period
(in time units, should be at least three times the round-trip estimate) ;</li>
<li><strong>False positives</strong>: the probability of direct or indirect probes being lost
is (gross approximation here, the real equation is a bit larger) <code>(1 - Delivery<em>%²)*(1 - Delivery</em>%⁴)^k</code>
— where <code>Delivery_%</code> is the probability of timely delivery of a
packet and <code>k</code> is the number of members used to perform indirect
probing). Notice how <code>k</code> is used as an exponent? It shows that
<strong>increasing the number of nodes used for indirect probing will rapidly
decrease the probability of having false positives</strong> ;</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: as the accuracy is directly correlated to the false positives,
we can calculate that with 95% of the packets successfully delivered and 3
nodes used for indirect probing, the protocol will have an accuracy of
99.9%. Again, this value increases as we increase <code>k</code> ;</li>
<li><strong>Network Message Load</strong>: as each node only pings one target each protocol period,
we moved from an <code>O(N²)</code> to something in <code>O(N)</code>. We
roughly have two packets (<code>PING</code> and <code>ACK</code>) and an
optional indirect probe (hence the 4 extra packets per relay node)
<code>(4*k + 2)*N</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> the speed of failure detection and the probability of false
positives don&rsquo;t depend on the number of nodes in the cluster (except
asymptotically). Which means that the protocol will scale nicely, even on large
clusters.</p>

<h2 id="a-more-robust-and-efficient-swim">A more robust and efficient <em>SWIM</em></h2>

<p>The version of the <em>SWIM</em> protocol we described so far could be qualified as «
<em>basic SWIM</em> ». It works and showcases the main ideas of the protocol, but it
suffers from a few issues and limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>the dissemination component still relies on network multicasts. However,
network multicast primitives such as IP multicast etc., are only best-effort
and most of the time they aren&rsquo;t even enabled on production systems ;</li>
<li>the failure detector doesn&rsquo;t handle well nodes that are perturbed for small
durations of time (overloaded host, unexpectedly long GC pause, …) ;</li>
<li>the basic SWIM failure detection protocol guarantees eventual detection of
the failure of an arbitrary node. However, it gives no deterministic
guarantees on the time between failure of an arbitrary node and its
detection at another arbitrary member (in terms of the number of local
protocol rounds).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in these limitations to better understand them and see what can be
done to go around.</p>

<h3 id="infection-style-dissemination">Infection-style dissemination</h3>

<p>The basic protocol propagates membership updates (joins, leaves and failures)
through the cluster using multicast primitives. Hardware multicast and IP
multicast are available on most networks and operating systems, but are rarely
enabled (for administrative or security reasons). The basic SWIM protocol would
then have to use a costly broadcast, or an inefficient point-to-point messaging
scheme, in order to disseminate the membership updates.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this type of multicast usually uses UDP and is a best-effort
protocol. Reliably maintaining the memberlist would prove challenging.</p>

<p>Instead of multicast, the authors of the <em>SWIM</em> protocol suggested a different
approach, eliminating the need for multicast altogether: <strong>piggybacking</strong>.</p>

<p>They took advantage of the fact that the protocol regularly sends messages to
other nodes (<code>PING</code>, <code>PING-REQ()</code>, <code>ACK</code>) so
they decided to include &ldquo;<em>gossip information</em>&rdquo; in these packets. This
dissemination mechanism is called &ldquo;<em>infection-style</em>&rdquo;, as information spreads
in a manner analogous to the spread of gossip in society, or epidemic in the
general population.</p>

<p>Notice that this implementation of the dissemination component does not generate
any extra packets (such as multicasts) - all &ldquo;messages&rdquo; handed to this component
are propagated by piggybacking on the packets of the failure detection component.
The network load remains the same as seen previously.</p>

<p>In the following example, we see how piggybacking can be used to disseminate
information:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>A</em> knows that <em>C</em> is dead ;</li>
<li><em>D</em> knows that <em>E</em> joined the cluster ;</li>
<li><em>A</em> directly probes <em>B</em> and includes a gossip indicating that <em>C</em> should be
considered as failed. <em>B</em> acknowledges and updates its own memberlist to
remove <em>C</em> ;</li>
<li><em>A</em> directly probes <em>D</em> and also indicates that <em>C</em> is dead. <em>D</em>
acknowledges and piggybacks the <code>ACK</code> packet to indicate that a
new node <em>E</em> has joined the cluster.</li>
</ol>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/swim_piggybacking.svg" />
    <figcaption>SWIM: infection-style dissemination</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Infection-style dissemination implies that members of the cluster might have a
different memberlist status as information takes more time to propagate. But it
has been shown that such epidemic process spreads exponentially fast and all the
nodes in the cluster will eventually (and rapidly) receive the gossips (it takes
<code>O(log(N))</code> time to reach every node).</p>

<p>To improve resiliency in case of nodes failures and packet losses, each node
has its own prioritized list of &ldquo;gossips&rdquo; to disseminate. And each packet sent
by the protocol can be used to piggyback a fixed amount of gossips.</p>

<h3 id="suspicion-mechanism">Suspicion mechanism</h3>

<p>The failure detector component can easily detect as dead a node due to packet
losses or because it was asleep for some time (because of a temporary issue, an
unusual load of work, GC pauses, …). The node would then be incorrectly
considered dead and forced to leave the cluster.</p>

<p>To mitigate this effect, a &ldquo;<em>suspicion</em>&rdquo; sub-protocol was introduced.</p>

<p>It works as follows. Consider a node <em>A</em> that chooses another node <em>B</em> as
<code>ping</code> target. If <em>A</em> receives no direct or indirect <code>ACK</code>
from <em>B</em>, it does NOT declare it dead. Instead, it marks the unresponsive node
as <em>suspected</em> in its local memberlist and it transfers this update to the
dissemination component.
Each node receiving the update also updates its local memberlist and keeps on
disseminating the update.</p>

<p>That being said, <strong>suspected members do stay on the memberlists</strong> and are treated
similarly to healthy members.</p>

<p>If any node receives an <code>ACK</code> from a suspected node, it un-suspects
the node and disseminate the information.
Similarly, if a node receive a gossip indicating that it is suspected, it can
start propagating a &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;m alive!&rdquo; message to clarify the situation.</p>

<p>After a predefined timeout, suspected nodes are marked as dead and the
information is propagated.</p>

<p>This mechanism reduces (but does not eliminate) the rate of failure detection
false positives. Notice also that the <em>Strong Completeness</em> property of the
original protocol continues to hold. Failures of processes suspecting a failed
process may prolong detection time, but eventual detection is still guaranteed.</p>

<p>From the above discussion, <code>Alive</code> messages override
<code>Suspect</code> messages, and <code>Confirm</code> messages override both
<code>Suspect</code> and <code>Alive</code> messages, in their effect on the
local membership list element corresponding to the suspected member.</p>

<p>However, a member might be suspected and unsuspected multiple times during its
lifetime. And as no ordering of the event between the nodes is guaranteed, the
following situation might happen:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/swim_unordered_updates.svg" />
    <figcaption>Two nodes, receiving ambiguous updates</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What&rsquo;s the status of <em>C</em>? Which node is right?
Without any additional information, <em>A</em> believes that <em>C</em> is alive whereas <em>B</em>
believes it&rsquo;s suspected.</p>

<p>To resolve this ambiguity, the updates need to be distinguished through unique
identifiers: an <em>incarnation number</em>. Each node will maintain its own
<em>incarnation number</em>. It&rsquo;s number set to 0 when the node joins the cluster and
can be <strong>incremented only by the node itself</strong>, when it receives information
about itself being suspected in the current incarnation. The suspected node will
then emit an <code>Alive</code> message with an incremented incarnation number
and disseminate it.</p>

<p>The incarnation number must be included, along a node identifier, in every
<code>Alive</code>, <code>Suspect</code> and <code>Confirm</code> messages. This
number will be used to <strong>establish an &ldquo;happens-before&rdquo; relationship between
events</strong>.
For instance:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/swim_ordered_updates.svg" />
    <figcaption>Two nodes, receiving unambiguous updates</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>receiving the message <code>{ Alive C, incarnation = 1 }</code> would override
 the message <code>{ Suspect C, incarnation = 0 }</code> as the incarnation
 number of the suspected <em>C</em> node is less than the alive <em>C</em> node.</li>
<li>on the other hand, the message <code>{ Alive C, incarnation = 1 }</code>
 would not be overridden by <code>{ Suspect C, incarnation = 0 }</code></li>
</ul>

<p>By comparing <em>incarnation numbers</em>, we can safely drop outdated messages and
still end-up in a coherent state across the cluster.</p>

<h3 id="deterministic-probe-target-selection">Deterministic probe-target selection</h3>

<p>In the first version of the protocol, the failure detector component chooses
randomly the node to probe. Although each node failure is guaranteed to be
detected eventually, a specially unlucky selection of nodes can lead to an
important delay between the failure and its detection.</p>

<p>This can be fixed by using a round-robin selection instead of a random one.
Joining nodes will be inserted in the member-list at random positions and when
the list traversal is complete, it is randomly rearranged before being traversed
again.</p>

<p>With this method, successive selections of the same target are at most
<code>(2n - 1)</code> protocol periods apart. This bounds the worst case
detection time of a node failure.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>SWIM</em> is a membership protocol designed to answer the question « <em>Which are
the alive nodes in a cluster?</em> » in a scalable way</li>
<li>the protocol is divided in two components: failure detection and information
 dissemination</li>
<li>the failure detector works by directly or indirectly probing nodes, at fixed
 intervals</li>
<li>the suspicion sub-protocol improves the failure detector&rsquo;s accuracy by giving
 time to nodes for recovery</li>
<li>information about the status of the cluster is disseminated using a
 infection-style method: events are included in the failure detection
 component and propagated as an infection or gossip would in real life, from
 peer to peer</li>
<li>selected nodes to probe using a randomized round-robin makes the failure
 detection deterministic</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="going-further">Going further</h2>

<p>While we went pretty deep in the <em>memberlist</em> problem, there are still a lof of
subjects we didn&rsquo;t explore:</p>

<ul>
<li>what happens in case of network partitions?</li>
<li>how does <em>SWIM</em> deal with nodes voluntarily leaving the cluster?</li>
<li>what about nodes re-joining?</li>
<li>we totally ignored security. Shouldn&rsquo;t the communications between nodes at
 least be encrypted?</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these concerns — and more — are addressed in <a href="https://www.serf.io/">Serf</a>.
Two of <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a>&rsquo;s products rely on a version of
the <em>SWIM</em> protocol enhanced by their teams: <a href="https://www.serf.io/">Serf</a> and <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>.</p>

<p>They provide a <a href="https://www.serf.io/docs/internals/gossip.html">guide</a> describing
what modifications they introduced to the protocol. A <a href="https://www.serf.io/docs/internals/simulator.html">convergence simulator</a>
can also be found on their website to visualize how fast a cluster will converge
to a consistent state.</p>

<h3 id="swim-in-go-memberlist"><em>SWIM</em> in Go: memberlist</h3>

<p>And last but not least, the Go implementation of their modified version of <em>SWIM</em>
is Open-Source and available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist">https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist</a></p>

<h2 id="wait-weren-t-you-initially-talking-about-a-key-value-store">Wait… weren&rsquo;t you initially talking about a key-value store?!</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s right! The idea for this post came from the fact that I am building a
key-value store prototype.</p>

<p>I wanted it to be distributed, so I documented myself about how to detect node
failures and how to maintain a membership list in a peer-to-peer cluster.</p>

<p>Now that this step is done, I will have to take advantage of all of this to
build the &ldquo;store aspect&rdquo; on top of it: how can I efficiently shard the data?
How to replicate it? How to rebalance it when new nodes are added? Or when nodes
fail?</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s for another day, in another post!</p>
