<p>After three years as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.tea-ebook.com/">TEA — The Ebook Alternative</a>,
<strong>I quit my job</strong>, I left my flat and I took my backpack and my shoes to travel
across Europe… in part to look for a job.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-i-quit">Why did I quit?</h2>

<p>When I was hired, one of my personal goals was to benefit from the knowledge
and experience of my coworkers to improve myself.</p>

<p><em>TEA</em> was — and still is — a company where talented people are building a
relatively complex platform and where I learned a lot by their side: I improved my
knowledge of PHP, I learned new languages, I helped introduce a testing culture,
I developed my skills in architecture, project management and teamwork. I even
gave <a href="/talks/">a few talks</a> in some big conferences.</p>

<p>But after a while, I felt like I was stagnating.</p>

<p>I felt comfortable in this company and <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/weekend.png">I was absolutely not afraid of Mondays</a>
but the excitement was gone. My work was not really challenging anymore.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided that it was time for me to move on to something different.
Something that would stimulate and challenge me everyday, where I could learn
new stuff and also maybe have a more positive impact on the outside world.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-looking-for">What am I looking for?</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good question: what kind of job am I looking for? What does
« stimulating » mean? Instead of « stimulating », maybe I should say « meaningful ».</p>

<p>Even if the technical aspect and the continuous improvement are extremely
important for me, they aren&rsquo;t the only ones that matter. I am also looking for
some kind of <em>ethical</em> dimension in my work and I actively avoid unethical jobs.</p>

<p>But what does all that even mean? Short answer: I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>

<p>I am not looking for « <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRUAJVKlUZQ">we&rsquo;re making the world a better place</a> »-style companies.
I am more interested in being useful while respecting my values. I enjoy working
on interesting projects and ideally I would also like to have an impact while
improving myself. Both technically and humanly.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the company&rsquo;s goal?</li>
<li>Who are their customers?</li>
<li>How could I be useful to both?</li>
<li>By working for them, will I go against my values?</li>
<li>Will I learn new things?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of questions I have in mind when I say « <em>meaningful</em> work ».</p>

<p>Working for Mozilla and being able to have a positive impact on literally
millions of users would be awesome. But I&rsquo;m also perfectly fine
with smaller projects and impacts.</p>

<p>For instance, I would love working with researchers in biology or physics. I
could make my technical expertise available and contribute with my skills to
help them in their day to day work.<br />
Another thing I can totally see myself do is providing tools for other teams
and developers. Working in an SRE team would be awesome too.</p>

<p>And doing that abroad would be even better!</p>

<h2 id="so-what-s-next">So, what&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>In the immediate future, I will probably start by having fun during my trip
across Europe. And while doing that, I&rsquo;ll try to meet developers and companies
along the way.</p>
